In this repositry i'm trying to apply my knowledge about data structure
I have started with linked-list of integers
the class called linkedlist has some methods 
isempty() to check if the list is empty or not
insertfirst(int) is using to add a new integer at the beginning of the list
display() is using to show the user what in the list
the all methods are expalined in details in the code
